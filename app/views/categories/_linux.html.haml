%p The Rails Prime stack runs on a Unix stack, which is to say that all production hardware (and most people's personal workstations) are some variant of that system. As such, you'll need to understand some basic Unix utilities to control your development environment. Thankfully, you don't need to be a sysadmin to navigate the waters of application development on Unix, so this will be a simple course.

  %h3 Getting Around the Filesystem: Absolute and Relative Paths
  %p There's not much to say for this one, navigating the filesystem is possibly the most basic thing you can do. If not a Mac / Linux user, you've probably still done this before. That said, take a moment to review some basics. A really common error for newer engineers is to accidentally conflate absolute and relative path when running commands.

  %h3 Everything is a File
  %p An important thing to understand when manipulating a Unix system is the principle that "Everything is a File". Ports and sockets, filesystems, directories and more are all treated as files for the purposes of manipulation. This is a benefit because it allows us a consistent way to manipulate I/O using common tools.

  %h3 Path and the Environment
  %p We rely heavily on environment variables to influence the behavior of our applications. For instance, when starting a rails server, we often pass a variable that tells it whether to start in development, integration or production mode.
  %p Path is also key to keeping control of your environment. By manipulating the path, we change which version of ruby and other utilities we're running on the fly. Oftentimes, when a command doesn't work the way you expected it to (or not at all), the problem lies in your execution path.

  %h3 Transferring Files Between Boxes

  %p Source control is a big topic, but you don't need to know everything up front. We're going to focus on the few basic commands that should let you do most of your work day-to-day.
  %p We strongly encourage pairing throughout Level UP courses (and on real work as well).  When committing your code via your partner's account, be sure to indicate that you are the author of the changes. Also make sure that you're using branches properly as part of your workflow.

  %h3 Managing File Permissions
  %p File permissions are the Unixy way of preventing total chaos and destruction on your system. So they're good. In source control, these permissions are tracked and held consistent across machines to make sure that only specified users can access resources.
  %p Beyond that, any time you download an executable, like a shell script, your OS will probably use permissions to stop you from executing that file. If you want to run that sweet sweet script, you're going to need to learn to change them.

  %h3 Why You Shouldn't Use sudo
  %p With great power comes great responsibility, right? Natch. Some commands you execute are going to need escalated privileges. For example, starting and stopping services, or installing new packages on a Linux system.
  %p Most users have unlimited sudo power on their systems. And sometimes, adding sudo to a command that's not working appears to "fix it". But down that way lies madness. By escalating yourself to root, erroneous commands have the ability to wreck your system. Resist the urge, and find a non-root way to execute the command.

  %h3 Monitoring System Resources
  %p Virtual machines typically have very limited resources, because they have to take them from a host machine. So, you may often find yourself running out of disk space, processor or memory resources. While it's obvious enough when a machine is slow, it may not be obvious which resource is in contention. Luckily, there are a few commands that can help you track down resource issues to fix them.

  %h3 What's a Port and How to Find It
  %p Most pieces of software, like SSH or your web browser, use ports to communicate with other computers. While it might not explicitly call this fact out, your browser knows that the typical ports for HTTP/S are 80 and 443. As we develop, we use ports that are unique across the entire organization to identify internal services and offer them for consumption.

  %h3 Finding, pausing and killing processes

  %h3 Starting and Stopping Services
  %p Aside from user-space programs you're accustomed to, Linux environments also run many services in the background.

  %h3 Why We Use Web Proxies
  %p In a complicated network environment, we use proxies all the time. Even within a single node, we usually have a proxy set up to listen for the machine and proxy requests back to the actual software.

There are some critical caveats to use of these proxies that you may need to know about.

  %h3 Firewalls, iptables, and nmap
  %p On most systems, and certainly on our production system, we limit traffic in and out of systems using a firewall. By allowing only whitelisted traffic to pass, we can eliminate large numbers of security vulnerabilities. All modern Linux systems use iptables to manage traffic. We have wrappers to iptables on our systems, but you should be able to view the rules as the need arises.
  %p Sometimes, it's not clear whether or not the firewall is blocking your traffic. From the host itself, the port may appear to be open, but requests are not being served properly. In this case, a good tool for "sniffing out" the misbehaving machine is nmap. You can use nmap to scan the machine and display a report of all ports that are open and listening.
